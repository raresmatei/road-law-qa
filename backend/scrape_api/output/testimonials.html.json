Søren Broberg Nielsen, Legal Information Division, Department of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Justice in Denmark “ELI foresaw a possibility of enriching legal acts and improving interoperability in and within the EU member states. Two biggest advantages of this tool, therefore, are: a) open treasury for legal data; b) voluntary participation. Interoperability of the EU legal data represented the beauty of the EU and provided the tool that is customable to varying national systems.” Gerry Matthews, The Electronic Irish Statute Book - eISB project manager, Office of the Attorney General “As a member of the ELI steering committee we always look to improve the ELI standard e.g. adding new properties to better describe legislation on-line.

We now have a more stable and standards based way of identifying and describing legislation on-line. The ELI solution is now the standard for identifying and describing legislation published on the eISB. Incorporating ELI provides us with the basis for improving access to legislation both directly and through open data formats such as XML and RDF.” Miguel PALMA and Miguel SILVA - Portugal’s e-government solutions - INCM - National Printing Office and Mint/ Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda “We have chosen ELI because ELI was introduced to us by professionals who presented and explained the various ELI advantages and implementation steps. ELI is advantageous compared to its alternatives. ELI has a future since the more countries decide to apply ELI in their legal information systems the better the functionality of it is going to be.” John Dann, Director, Central Legislation Service, Ministry of State - Luxembourg “Other partial solutions exist and aim at standardising how legislation is structured.

    "text": "the better the functionality of it is going to be.” John Dann, Director, Central Legislation Service, Ministry of State - Luxembourg “Other partial solutions exist and aim at standardising how legislation is structured. However, ELI is the only solution that makes use of semantic web technologies to standardise, exchange and connect legislation. Semantic web technologies link and express legislation data in such a way that separate pieces of information get a meaning that relies on the context of all interlinked data. Thus, ELI is not only a system that scans key words and searches their representations in legal context, but also a system that retrieves legal information based on the contextual meaning and logical relationship, which is understandable by computers and humans. To use ELI solution, keep in mind: Create user-friendly URIs Analyse your metadata and create your ontologies before converting your legal information Rethink your data and how your metadata can express it best Invest into analysis and anticipate how new features could be added in the future.” Susana Gomez, Spanish ELI coordinator, State Agency for the Official State Gazette “The Spanish legal system is complex and diverse, comprising rules corresponding to different territorial levels: State, regional (the Autonomous"

    "text": "metadata can express it best Invest into analysis and anticipate how new features could be added in the future.” Susana Gomez, Spanish ELI coordinator, State Agency for the Official State Gazette “The Spanish legal system is complex and diverse, comprising rules corresponding to different territorial levels: State, regional (the Autonomous Communities) and local. Each of these territorial levels has its own official journal and its own legislative information system, so interoperability was something difficult to achieve. This situation has changed thanks to ELI. Once the different Spanish Administrations have entirely implemented ELI, all of them will share a common way of identifying legal resources in the web and a common set of metadata. Those elements are the base for efficient interoperability among the different Spanish legal information systems and with the European ones too. This way, it will be easier to develop new and better services for citizens and legal practitioners. Instead of creating a system from the beginning that could help us improve interoperability, ELI has offered a fully designed solution that only needed to be adapted to our specific needs.\" The Spanish ELI Working Group © Ministry of Justice in Denmark © Office of the Attorney General, Ireland"
