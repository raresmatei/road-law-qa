More on lawmaking procedures Less on lawmaking procedures EU lawmaking procedures set out the stages leading to the adoption of legal acts, as well as the institutions and bodies involved and their respective roles. They vary according to the policy area and type of act concerned. The legislative procedure refers to the process by which the ‘co-legislators’ (the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union) adopt legal acts: regulations , directives and decisions . Legal acts of the European Union adopted through the legislative procedure are legislative acts . The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes provision for two types of legislative procedures: ordinary legislative procedure; special legislative procedures.

    "text": "the legislative procedure are legislative acts . The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes provision for two types of legislative procedures: ordinary legislative procedure; special legislative procedures. Ordinary legislative procedure Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the ordinary legislative procedure is the main legislative procedure for EU decision-making, where the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union act jointly as ‘co-legislators’. Before that, it was commonly known as the 'codecision procedure'. Special legislative procedures This applies to specific cases set out in the Treaty. Unlike the ordinary legislative procedure, there is no single process for adopting acts under these procedures. A legal act can be adopted under a special legislative procedure by: the European Parliament with the participation of the Council; the Council with the participation of the European Parliament. Non-legislative procedures EU institutions can also adopt non-legislative acts . The lawmaking procedures section on EUR-Lex includes interinstitutional non-legislative procedures for acts adopted mostly by the Council on a proposal from the Commission. Procedures for legal acts adopted by the Commission only (autonomous acts), including Commission implementing and delegated acts, can be found in the internal procedures section. Abbreviations"

An internal procedure is a series of stages in the internal decision-making process in an institution or a body. The procedure stages differ depending on the type of procedure, the institution involved and its rules of procedure. The outcome of an internal procedure can be an act adopted by one institution only (e.g. a Commission autonomous act in the form of implementing act) or a document that is part of an interinstitutional lawmaking procedure (e.g. a Commission proposal or an opinion of European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)). Information on internal procedures has only been uploaded to EUR-Lex since July 2016 and currently it is available only with regard to the EESC. For instance, you can find the internal procedures that lead to the adoption of Commission’s proposals or delegated/implementing acts, and the EESC’s opinions.
