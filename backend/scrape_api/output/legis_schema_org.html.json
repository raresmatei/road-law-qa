Good practices for the description of Legislation in schema.org What does schema:Legislation means ? The schema:Legislation type in schema.org may be used to describe different things: A base act published in an Official Journal. This is the “birth” of a legal act. An amending act , also published in an official journal, amending the base act. This is expressed like a “diff” applied on the base act ( “In the base act, point 2 of article 3 is replaced by the following : ….” ) A consolidated version of the base act, as amended by one or more amending act. This is the base act, with all its “diffs” applied on it. The “abstract” act , that is the act as an intellectual"

This is the base act, with all its “diffs” applied on it. The “abstract” act , that is the act as an intellectual work, independantly of one of its (consolidated) version. This is intuitively what we are using when writing a legal reference without specifying a version : “Council Directive (EC) 93/104 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time [1993] OJ L307/18 (Working Time Directive)” . An article or another subdivision inside the base act, or one of its version. Base act, amending acts, consolidated versions, abstract act The relation between the base act, its amending act, the resulting consolidated versions, and the abstract act is shown in the diagram below: This is the sequence of events that this diagram depicts : A base act is published in an Official Journal.

A first amending act is published in the Official Journal. The base act and the first amending act are consolidated in Consolidated act V1 A second amending act is published in the Official Journal. The base act, the first and second amending acts are consolidated in Consolidated act V2. There are a few important things to note: Even though the textual content of the Consolidated version V0 is identical to the base act, it is really considered as another document, hence another entity. It is usually not published by the same system, does not have the same legal value as the base act, is not under the same responsibilities, may differ in its cover page or number, is not presented in the same web page, etc. For all these reasons, it is something different - but related. The abstract act encompasses the successive consolidated versions of the act, but not the base act itself.

The base act “gives birth to” the consolidated versions, but is not considered a version in itself; instead the consolidated version v0 represents the first version of the act. As they are not versionned strictly speaking, the base act and the amending acts do not have their “abstract” level, like the consolidated versions have. The relationships between these entities is as follow: The abstract act refers to its successive versions using the schema:workExample property. (in the web pages of each consolidated version, only one of these links will be present, not all). Each consolidated version of the act points to the base act and all the amending acts being consolidated in this version using the schema:legislationConsolidates property.
