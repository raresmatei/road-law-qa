The ELI annotation tool is used for building notices describing several legal entities (legal resources, legal expressions and formats) using standard properties. The values of these properties are constrained using controlled vocabularies described with the SKOS standard ​ ​ . The result of the work is a small file to insert into the HTML of the page published on the Official Journal website. Notices can be created for the following different types of resources: acts, official journals, and consolidation.

It is meant to facilitate the integration of ELI in XML-based document workflows. Study on how users of legislation access transposition information In European Union law, transposition is the process by which the EU Member States give force to a EU directive by adopting national implementation measures. The ELI Taskforce conducted a study in order to gain deeper insight into how users of legislation access and work with transposition information. The goal of this study was to determine what website enhancements would best meet usability interests and share these results with national legislation publishers. The study was subdivided into three different parts which are explained in the presentation accessible on the following link: Study on how users of legislation access transposition information .
